Here are some of my favourite accessibility resources and tools.

## Testing plug-ins and bookmarklets

### [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview/)

**Developer**: Microsoft

Accessibility Insights for Web is an extension for Chrome and Edge that helps developers and testers find and fix accessibility issues in web apps and sites.

According to Microsoft, the tool supports two primary scenarios:

1. *FastPass* is a lightweight, two-step process that helps developers identify common, high-impact accessibility issues in less than five minutes. It uses the popular [axe-core testing engine](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) by Deque. 
2. *Assessment* allows anyone with HTML skills to verify that a web app or web site is compliant with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1&levels=aaa).

**Pros**: I like this tool because of it's intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It's also a great learning tool for the newly initiated because of it's excellent built-in documentation. The exported HTML reports are very attractive and 

**Cons**: The claim that "anyone with HTML skills" can complete a full assessment is a bit exagerated. IMHO, you still need some background and training in web accessibility testing to full enterpret some of the more complex guided assessment steps.
